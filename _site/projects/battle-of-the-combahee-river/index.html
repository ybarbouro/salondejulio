  <p>The Battle of the Combahee River was a battle of the American Revolutionary War fought on August 26, 1782, near Beaufort, South Carolina, one of many such confrontations after the Siege of Yorktown to occur before the British evacuated Charleston in December 1782. Of note is the death of 27-year-old Colonel John Laurens, “one of the bravest and most gallant of the American officers.”</p>
